# NodeJS_sandbox
My repository for the long road ahead of becoming a NodeJS dev--with some Linux and front-end frameworks sprinkled on top. ;)

Learn
1. At all possible, we are trying to learn how to use NodeJS by building projects. In addition, we want to learn any other useful plugins, tech, or tools that will assist in the ultimate goal of becoming a NodeJS dev and better at building apps and writing clean, reusuable, scalable Javascript code.
2. Though NodeJS is the focus, using front-end frameworks such as React and/or Aurelia is fine to give our app a pretty face. 
3. Have fun. Learn. Enjoy the process.  

RULES

Commenting/Documentation
1. All files MUST have comments explaining the purpose, any complex functions or concepts, and/or anything ambiguous/abstract.
2. All projects MUST have a README.md explaining the purpose of a project, what is to be achieved, and any set-up instructions (acting as if someone with now dev background came in, they could set up and run our apps).

Tests
1. All files SHOULD have unit tests to ensure they it works as expected. Unit test files should coincide with the naming conventions of the file it is responsible for testing, appending a 'test.js' to the end of the filename. i.e. server_test.js
2. All connecting files (files that require, import, etc. from other files) SHOULD have integration tests. 
3. All projects SHOULD have E2E tests.
